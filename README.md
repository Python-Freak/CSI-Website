### Frontend
- **For now just the client (i.e the frontend has been created)**
- **You guys will be working under client folder for the backend**

#### Instructions:
- Under the client folder a src/Pages subfolder is created. All the new pages will be added there.
- The name of all pages  should be in **PascalCase** and not in **camelCase**
- Each page can have multiple sub-components, so if a page has (Page-Specific) components each of the Page Folder should also have a Components Folder
- The one who creates a new page is responsible for adding it to the React-Router in the **src/App.js**.
- For the components that are reused between multiple pages a global Components folder has been **src/Components**.
- Variable names should be sensible and should fllow **camelCase**
